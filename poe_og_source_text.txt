A Dream
In visions of the dark night
 I have dreamed of joy departed-
 But a waking dream of life and light
 Hath left me broken-hearted.
 Ah! what is not a dream by day
 To him whose eyes are cast
 On things around him with a ray
 Turned back upon the past?
 That holy dream- that holy dream,
 While all the world were chiding,
 Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
 A lonely spirit guiding.
 What though that light, thro' storm and night,
 So trembled from afar-
 What could there be more purely bright
 In Truth's day-star?


A Dream Within A Dream
Take this kiss upon the brow!
 And, in parting from you now,
 Thus much let me avow-
 You are not wrong, who deem
 That my days have been a dream;
 Yet if hope has flown away
 In a night, or in a day,
 In a vision, or in none,
 Is it therefore the less gone?
 All that we see or seem
 Is but a dream within a dream.
 I stand amid the roar
 Of a surf-tormented shore,
 And I hold within my hand
 Grains of the golden sand-
 How few! yet how they creep
 Through my fingers to the deep,
 While I weep- while I weep!
 O God! can I not grasp
 Them with a tighter clasp?
 O God! can I not save
 One from the pitiless wave?
 Is all that we see or seem
 But a dream within a dream?


A Valentine


For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
 Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
 Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies
 Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
 Search narrowly the lines! - they hold a treasure
 Divine- a talisman- an amulet
 That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure-
 The words- the syllables! Do not forget
 The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor
 And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
 Which one might not undo without a sabre,
 If one could merely comprehend the plot.
 Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
 Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus
 Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
 Of poets, by poets- as the name is a poet's, too,
 Its letters, although naturally lying
 Like the knight Pinto- Mendez Ferdinando-
 Still form a synonym for Truth- Cease trying!
 You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.


Alone


From childhood's hour I have not been
 As others were; I have not seen
 As others saw; I could not bring
 My passions from a common spring.
 From the same source I have not taken
 My sorrow; I could not awaken
 My heart to joy at the same tone;
 And all I loved, I loved alone.
 Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
 Of a most stormy life- was drawn
 From every depth of good and ill
 The mystery which binds me still:
 From the torrent, or the fountain,
 From the red cliff of the mountain,
 From the sun that round me rolled
 In its autumn tint of gold,
 From the lightning in the sky
 As it passed me flying by,
 From the thunder and the storm,
 And the cloud that took the form
 (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
 Of a demon in my view.


An Acrostic


Elizabeth it is in vain you say
'Love not' — thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L. E. L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breathe it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love — was cured of all beside —
His folly — pride — and passion — for he died.


An Enigma


"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
 "Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
 Through all the flimsy things we see at once
 As easily as through a Naples bonnet-
 Trash of all trash!- how can a lady don it?
 Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff-
 Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
 Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
 And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
 The general tuckermanities are arrant
 Bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent-
 But this is, now- you may depend upon it-
 Stable, opaque, immortal- all by dint
 Of the dear names that he concealed within 't.
